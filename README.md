# Covid-19 Analysis

# Overview / Research Questions
The COVID-19 pandemic forced the entire world into a new era, for better or worse. In monitoring and managing novel diseases, both the WHO and CDC collected a broad amount of data on a daily basis from 01/11/2020 up until 03/09/2023. We used this data to examine multiple topics, from infection rates between high-population density areas and low-density areas. In addition to that we looked at analyzing the effects of the virus on education attainment.

## Research Questions and Motivations
The members in our group were each individually interested and – of course, impacted by the pandemic, and were interested in investigating potential relationships between COVID-19 and our topics.

1. How did COVID infections impact areas of higher population density than areas of lower population density?

2. How did our tourism economy perform prior to and during Covid?

3. How did COVID affect education?

# Data Exploration and Clean-Up Process
The data we downloaded from John’s Hopkins’ GitHub repository was in .csv format, meaning that it was readily available to be uploaded into our Jupyter Notebook. The data was cleaned and standardized, making sure we have uniform column headings. We ran tests to check and ensure we had all and only the unique languages in our dataset. 

# Data Analysis Process
To do the analysis, we ran a few different tests and presentations on the data:

We compared tourist revenue to new covid cases by line plotting them on separate axises and comparing them overtime.

# Hypothesis Testing
We tested multiple different hypothesis:

GeoPolygon Plot
We created a plot that displays the change in reported cases that is run on a per 100k population basis to give a better understanding of the change over time. 


# Conclusion


We can conclude that government policies impacted tourism revenue more than number of covid cases over time.
